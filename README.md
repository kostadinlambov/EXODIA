EXODIA (Enterprise Xerox Open Delivery Information Application) is an application which manages a queue of documents to be printed. Normally this process is managed by the printers (after all itâ€™s the 21st century). However, some companies do not think like that and they use printers from BC. One such company is the ORACLE corporation (Obscurely Ruthless Amateur Crazy Lunatic Employees), which has hired me to implement the EXODIA application platform.
